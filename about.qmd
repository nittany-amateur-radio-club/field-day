Field Day is an event organized by the [American Radio Relay League (ARRL)](https://arrl.org), the membership organization for amateur radio operators (hams) in the U.S.

Field Day is an open house to show-off amateur radio to the public, an exercise in portable or field radio operations, and a contest to see which stations can earn the most points.

NARC will operate under the club callsign [W3YA](https://qrz.com/db/w3ya) with two high frequency (HF) transmitters capable of long-distance communication and a bonus VHF+ station, making this a class 2A (two alpha) operation.
The location will be the Pleasant Gap Fire Company training grounds at 475 Robinson Lane in Pleasant Gap, PA.
